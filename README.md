# Tic-Tac-Toe
### ðŸ”¸Game details:
<p>This game is a two-player game that works for two clients.</p>
<p>In this game, we have three lands of different sizes, the first land contains 9 houses, the second land contains 16 houses, and the third land contains 21 houses.</p>
<p>When the clients connect to the server, each player can choose the land, but the first player can choose a house from that land whose his/her client is connected to the server first.</p>
<p>Each player in his/her turn has 20 seconds to choose his desired house, if he/she does not choose a house in the desired time, he/she loses and the opposite player wins. Similarly, if a player enters --exit, and leaves the game, he/she loses and the opposite player wins.</p>
<p>Each player can get a series of information about the game by using -h or --help, such as the names of the land, the number of houses in each land, and the shape of the land.</p>
<p>Any player who first fills three houses in a row from a horizontal or vertical row wins and the game ends.</p>
