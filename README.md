# Tic-Tac-Toe
### ðŸ”¸Game details:
<p>This game is a two-player game that works for two clients.</p>
<p>In this game, we have three lands of different sizes, the first land contains 9 houses, the second land contains 16 houses, and the third land contains 21 houses.</p>
<p>When the clients connect to the server, each player can choose the land, but the first player can choose a house from that land whose his/her client is connected to the server first.</p>
<p>Each player in his/her turn has 20 seconds to choose his desired house, if he/she does not choose a house in the desired time, he/she loses and the opposite player wins. Similarly, if a player enters --exit, and leaves the game, he/she loses and the opposite player wins.</p>
<p>Each player can get a series of information about the game by using -h or --help, such as the names of the land, the number of houses in each land, and the shape of the land.</p>
<p>Any player who first fills three houses in a row from a horizontal or vertical row wins and the game ends.</p>

### ðŸ”¸Things we expect to implement in the future:
<p>1- A timer of 20 seconds should be shown for each player on his own page.</p>
<p>2- This server should support more than two clients and run several games at the same time and show the number of online players.</p>
<p>3- Creating a chat page where each player can chat with his opponent.</p>

### ðŸ”¸How to run the game:
<p>It is enough to open each of the .cpp files in a separate console environment such as Visual Studio. After that, we must run the server.cpp file first and then the client.cpp files.</p>
